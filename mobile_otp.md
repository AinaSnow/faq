# XIVLauncher Authenticator App

You can use an app together with XIVLauncher to automatically log yourself in without needing to type the OTP code manually.
<br>
The app will send the code over your local network to XIVLauncher, which will use it to log you in.

## Setup
### 1. Installation
You can download the newest version of the app from the [app releases page](https://github.com/goaaats/xl-authenticator/releases/latest). You can also find the source code on the linked repository.

#### Android
Download the APK file from the linked releases page and open it. You will be prompted to allow Chrome/your browser to install applications from unknown sources.
<br>
After allowing this installation, you will be able to find the app on your regular app drawer.

#### iOS
Since we can't publish the app on the App Store, you will have to use an alternative store like [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) to install the app. You can also use a Jailbroken device with AppSync Unified from [Karen's repo](https://cydia.akemi.ai/?page/net.angelxwind.appsyncunified).

### 2. Registering the app
To use the app as an OTP Token, you have to register it with your Square Enix account.
<br>
You can do so on the [Mog Station](https://secure.square-enix.com/account/app/svc/mogstation) by choosing "Manage Square Enix Account" and then clicking the "One Time Password" option in the title bar. 

On the resulting page, you can then choose "Other authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, etc.)". You will see a QR code.
