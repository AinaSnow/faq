### Q: How do I install/enable plugins?
Not sure how to install plugins? Just type `/xlplugins` in-game after you see that the in-game hook has loaded.

Note: Disabled plugins are not uninstalled. You'll need to manually delete them if you want to remove all traces of the plugin.

### Q: What is the command for \<insert plugin here\>?
While some plugins will list their command from the plugin install window, use `/xlhelp` to list their command and description.

You can also check out the [Plugin Gallery](https://github.com/goatcorp/DalamudPlugins/wiki/Plugin-Gallery) to see if there's some quick documentation, or check the plugin's repo for a readme.
